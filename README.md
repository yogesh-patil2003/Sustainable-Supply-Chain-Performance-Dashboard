# Sustainable Supply Chain Performance Dashboard

This project showcases a **Power BI dashboard** built to monitor and optimize supply chain performance using data-driven insights. The dashboard helps stakeholders evaluate supplier performance, analyze logistics costs, track defect rates, and assess sustainability metrics.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Supplier Scorecards** — Evaluate pass/fail inspection results across suppliers.
- 🚚 **Logistics Cost Analysis** — Compare shipping carriers and identify costly routes.
- ♻️ **Sustainability Metrics** — Track CO₂ impact of transportation modes (e.g., Rail vs Air).
- 🛠️ **Defect Rate Analysis** — Identify low-performing SKUs and suppliers.
- ⚠️ **Predictive Alerts** — Flag products with low stock or high defect risks.
- 🌍 **Interactive Maps and Slicers** — Visual exploration of supplier regions and performance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technology

- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation and interactive visualization.
- **Excel**: Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **DAX**: Custom metrics like Total Revenue, Avg. Defect Rate, etc.
- **Power BI Features**: Drill-down charts, slicers, data modeling, and maps.
